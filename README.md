## Project Overview

This project aim to develop a deep learning model for TB classification using 3,500 normal and 700 TB-positive chest X-ray images from the National Library of Medicine and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. As TB remains a leading infectious disease, early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. However, manual chest X-ray analysis by radiologists is time-consuming, subjective, and resource-intensive, particularly in underserved areas. Leveraging deep learning can enhance diagnostic efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize resource allocation in the healthcare industry. 

We experimented with various architectures:
- DNNs: Models with different hidden layers.
- CNNs: Standard and dropout-regularized models.
- Transfer Learning: Pre-trained InceptionV3 and DenseNet201 models.

Among all models tested, the CNN with dropout regularization achieved the highest validation accuracy of 0.996, demonstrating its strong potential for automated TB screening. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of deep learning in improving TB detection, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for global healthcare challenges.
